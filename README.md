# PowerBI
End to End PowerBi Project
I'm excited to share my latest project, where I utilized MySQL Workbench and Power BI skills to tackle real-world problems for AtliQ Hardware, an emerging tech giant in the competitive computer hardware market. This project features interactive dashboards that analyze sales transactions and customer reports, aiding in quick, data-driven decisions. 

Used MySQL Workbench to execute SQL queries for data extraction., ETL for data transformation, and Power BI for visualization. Some key insights from the Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize the company's financial and sales data over the past few years:
